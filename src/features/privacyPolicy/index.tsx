                <li>
                  Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you
                  to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there
                  is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also
                  have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal
                  information where you have exercised your right to object to
                  processing.

                <li>
                  Object to processing of your personal information where we are
                  relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party)
                  and there is something about your particular situation which
                  makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You
                  also have the right to object where we are processing your
                  personal information for direct marketing purposes.

                <li>
                  Request the restriction of processing of your personal
                  information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the
                  processing of personal information about you, for example if
                  you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for
                  processing it.
